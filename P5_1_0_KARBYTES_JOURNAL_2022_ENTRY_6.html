<p>14_AUGUST_2022: I applied to two job openings at one of the Target stores in Dublin for cashiering and general merchandise roles, but saw that the candidate website would not let me update my phone number. I decided to apply for at least one more job which I saw posted on Indeed dot Com: a mail sorter job at a facility which is within walking distance of the San Leandro BART station. I will just avoid customer service jobs like the plague and only apply for &#8220;back of house&#8221; jobs which are not food industry jobs and which amount to package handling and mail sorting. I think that I should avoid jobs which have me working more than 8 hours per shift because such jobs are cutting too much into my recovery and recreation time.</p>
