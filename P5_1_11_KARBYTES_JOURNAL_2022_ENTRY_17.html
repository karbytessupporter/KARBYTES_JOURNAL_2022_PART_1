<p>17_AUGUST_2022: While sitting in <a style="background:#000000;color:#ff9000;" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.com/karbytes_journal_2022_entry_8/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AJP</a>&#8216;s parked car with AJP, we somehow got onto the subject of mortality. AJP said that he would be content to live for more than 100 years but not more than 200 years. I asked him why he would not want live forever. He said he did not want to live forever because, with living, there comes stress and torture. I posited that it is impossible to escape the stress and torture which life sometimes (or oftentimes) entails for the person going through a particular lifetime. In particular, I said that it is possible that, once a person dies, that person will be reincarnated as a &#8220;lower level&#8221; information processing agent (e.g. transitioning from a human to a rat), a &#8220;higher level&#8221; information processing agent (e.g. transitioning from a human to a reality bending alien), or as a &#8220;same level&#8221; information processing agent (e.g. reliving the same lifetime more than once (perhaps with some variations which were different from the previous rendering)). I also posited that a person may just cease to be reincarnated as any sentient information processing agent after that person dies.</p>
<p>By the way, I was able to get a new key to use my parents&#8217; blue Toyota Matrix minivan. Yes, I feel bad using it because it burns petroleum (which is bad for the environment and which is responsible for wars for control over fossil fuel reserves), but having to walk so much and have so little time off from walking myself ragged has been torturous for me. I decided that I would try to minimize how much I drive that vehicle and alternate between driving and walking/riding BART. When I am not using that vehicle, I leave I tentatively plan to keep it parked in front of <a style="background:#000000;color:#ff9000;" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.com/karbytes_journal_2022_entry_9/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SED</a>&#8216;s house in San Leandro (which is within a mile of my mom&#8217;s house and which is within a quarter mile of a nice neighborhood park which seamlessly connects to the giant hilly cow pasture I grew up in and still frequently camp at).</p>
<p>I am attempting to get a bicycle as soon as feasible. Most likely, I will have to get a job before I can get a bicycle. If I ask nicely, I might be able to get my mom to help me pay for a new bike in one fell swoop. Otherwise, I&#8217;ll slowly save up money for a new bicycle (and I currently get about $40 per day from my mom in the form of a transfer to my personal PayPal; account except for Friday. On Friday I usually get $100 through that arrangement).</p>
